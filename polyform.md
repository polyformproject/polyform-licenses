# Polyform Project License Language

## Acceptance

In order to get any license under these terms, you must agree to their rules.  Those rules are both obligations under the agreement and conditions to all the licenses granted to you under these terms.  The licensor may not revoke any licenses granted under these terms, but your licenses may end if you break any rule of these terms.

## Copyright License

The licensor grants you a copyright license for the software, to do everything you might do with the software that would infringe the licensor's copyright in it, for any permitted purpose.  However, you may not distribute the software, or make changes or new works based on the software, unless these terms grant you an additional license to do so.

## DL: Distribution License

The licensor grants you an additional copyright license to distribute copies of the software.  You must ensure that anyone who gets a copy of any part of the software from you also gets the text of these terms or a link to their text on <https://polyformproject.org>.

## CL: Changes and New Works License

The licensor grants you an additional copyright license to make changes and new works based on the software for any permitted purpose.

## Patent License

The licensor grants you a patent license for the software that covers patent claims the licensor can license, or becomes able to license, that you would infringe by doing anything you are licensed to do under these terms.

## Noncommercial Purposes

Any noncommercial purpose is a permitted purpose.

## Noncommercial Organizations

Use by any charitable organization, educational institution, public research organization, public safety or health organization, environmental protection organization, or government institution is a permitted purpose, even if that use involves occasional arguably commercial uses.

## Fair Use

You may have other "fair use" rights for the software under the law.  These terms do not limit them.

## SB: Small Business

It is a permitted purpose to use the software for the benefit of your company if it has less than 100 total employees and individual independent contractors, and less than 1,000,000 USD total revenue in the prior tax year.

## FT: Free Trial

It is a permitted purpose to evaluate whether the software suits a particular application, on behalf of you or your company, for less than 32 consecutive calendar days.

## IB: Internal Business Use

It is a permitted purpose to use the software for the internal business operations of you and your company.

## No Other Rights

These terms do not allow you to sublicense or transfer any licenses granted under these terms to anyone else, or prevent the licensor from granting licenses to anyone else.  These terms do not imply any other licenses.

## Patent Defense

If you or your company makes any written claim alleging that the software infringes or contributes to infringement of a patent, your patent license granted under these terms ends immediately.

## No Liability

***As far as the law allows, the software comes as is, without any warranty or condition, and the licensor will not be liable to you for any damages arising out of these terms or the use, distribution, or nature of the software, under any kind of legal claim.***

## Excuse

If you are notified in writing that you have broken any rule of these terms, you can keep the licenses granted to you under these terms by coming fully into compliance with these terms within 30 days of receiving the notice.  If you do not stop violating these terms within that time, all licenses for the software granted to you under these terms end immediately.  This excuse section is only available to you once.

## Definitions

The licensor is the individual or entity giving this license, and the software is the software the licensor makes available under these terms.

You refers to the individual or entity agreeing to and receiving licenses under these terms.

Your company is any legal entity, sole proprietorship, or other group that you work for, plus all entities that have control over, are under the control of, or are under common control with that group.  Control means ownership of substantially all the assets of an entity, or the power to direct its management and policies by vote, contract, or otherwise.  Control can be direct or indirect.
